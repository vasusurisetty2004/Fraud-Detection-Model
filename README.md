# Fraud Detection Model

## Overview
This project focuses on building a **Fraud Detection Model** using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to accurately identify fraudulent activities with a high degree of precision.

### Key Achievements
- üìä **96.82% Accuracy**: Successfully achieved 96.82% accuracy in fraud detection using the **Random Forest Classifier**.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Data Integrity**: Improved data quality by **33%** through handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- üîç **Model Experiments**: Conducted experiments with **classification** and **regression** algorithms to identify the most suitable approach for fraud detection.

## Model Building Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values using imputation techniques.
   - Encoded categorical variables for better model performance.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Analyzed data distribution and correlations.
   - Selected key features to enhance predictive accuracy.

3. **Model Training**
   - Applied **Random Forest Classifier** due to its robustness and ensemble learning capabilities.
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Achieved **96.82% accuracy**.
   - Evaluated model using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vasusurisetty2004/fraud-detection-model.git
   cd fraud-detection-model
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

## Future Improvements
- Explore advanced ensemble techniques (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
- Implement real-time fraud detection pipelines.
- Optimize model performance for large-scale datasets.
